# NuGet V3 latest resource

This prototypes the NuGet V3 "latest" resource to power Visual Studio's "Updates" tab in the Package Manager UI.

## Proposed protocol

### Versioning

The following [service index `@type`s](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview#resources-and-schema) are used:

@type value | Notes
-- | --
Latest/1.0.0 | The initial release

### Base URL

The base URL for the following APIs is the value of the `@id` property associated with the aforementioned resource `@type` value. In the following document, the placeholder base URL `{@id}` will be used.

### HTTP methods

All URLs found in the latest resource support the HTTP methods `GET` and `HEAD`.

### Latest versions

Fetch the metadata for a package's latest stable and pre-release versions, excluding unlisted versions.

```
GET {@id}/{LOWER_ID}/latest.json
```

#### Request parameters

Name | In | Type | Required | Notes
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
LOWER_ID | URL | string | yes | The package ID, lowercased

#### Response

If the package source has no versions of the provided package ID, a 404 status code is returned.

If the package source has one or more versions, including unlisted versions, a 200 status code is returned. The response body is a JSON object with the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Notes
-- | -- | -- | --
stable | [`catalogEntry` object](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource#catalog-entry) | No | The metadata for the package's latest stable version, excluding unlisted versions, or `null` if the package does not have any stable versions.
pre-release | [`catalogEntry` object](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource#catalog-entry) | No | The metadata for the package's latest version, including pre-releases but excluding unlisted versions, or `null` if the package does not have any versions.

#### Sample request

## SDK Sample

The project provides a client SDK to interact with the latest resource:

```cs
using var http = new HttpClient();

var clientFactory = new NuGetClientFactory(http, "https://package-source");
var serviceIndexClient = clientFactory.CreateServiceIndexClient();

var latestClient = new LatestClient(serviceIndexClient, http);
var latest = await latestClient.GetLatestOrNullAsync("Newtonsoft.Json");

Console.WriteLine($"Latest stable version: {latest.Stable.Version}");
Console.WriteLine($"Latest stable description: {latest.Stable.Description}");
```

<details>
<summary>âš  Current SDK is a bit hacky. Ideally usage would look like...</summary>

```cs
using var http = new HttpClient();

var clientFactory = new NuGetClientFactory(http, "https://package-source");
var client = clientFactory.CreateLatestClient();

var latest = await latestClient.GetLatestOrNullAsync("Newtonsoft.Json");

Console.WriteLine($"Latest stable version: {latest.Stable.Version}");
Console.WriteLine($"Latest stable description: {latest.Stable.Description}");
```
